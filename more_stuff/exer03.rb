# What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

# Exception handling is a controlled method for dealing with errors that occur as a program is running.
# Exception handling allows a program to continue running even when an error occurs, and allows us
# to deal with the exception/error in some manner, even if that is simply logging the error.
